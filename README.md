# Raul Battistini's Portfolio

> Project bootstrapped with [Vite](http://vitejs.dev/). To see in browser, clone the project with `git clone` [repo link](https://github.com/raulbattistini/portfolio) or with SSH, run `react-scripts` install and `react-scripts` start to see it live in browser.

\
The portfolio has samples of previous projects, their status, technologies I use, blog posts, contact details and personal trivia.

### Quite honestly, it'd be better suited if done with plain old HTML/ CSS and JavaScript.
